## Welcome to Jiahong Wang's Blog Page

My name is Jiahong Wang, I am a machine enthusiastic. 

The purpost of this blog is to share my experiences about working on machine learning projects.

- 1. A fairly good project with great documentation is much better than a very good project with bad documentation or no documentation.
- 2. Code is written to be viewed and shared by people, then it is executed by machine. So, readibility and easy to understand is very important.
- 3. Name a variable is very important, it really affect the quality of your code.
